# Environmental impacts of continuous integration

Continuous integration (CI) is used across the world to build, test, and deploy software. But as [human-induced climate change is causing dangerous and widespread disruption in nature and affecting the lives of billions of people around the world](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/resources/press/press-release/), what impact does running all this CI have on our planet?

Since I couldn't find any good answers to that question, this repository is an attempt to find out.
